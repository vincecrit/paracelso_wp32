    abstract      = {Even in the absence of serious injuries and fatalities, landslide and flood events can have significant socio-economic impacts. These include the severance of access to and from relatively remote communities for services and markets for goods; employment, health and educational opportunities; and social activities. The economic impacts can be classified as: direct economic impacts, direct consequential economic impacts, and indirect consequential economic impacts. In addition, the vulnerability shadow cast can be extensive and its geographical extent can be determined by the transport network rather than the relatively small footprint of the event itself. Using a number of debris flow events and a flood event in Scotland this paper places values on the economic impacts of landslides and floods. It also demonstrates the widespread impact of the events by means of the vulnerability shadow that is cast.}

    abstract      = {Facilities such as buildings, highways, railways, bridges, dams and pipelines often are built on natural slopes where the risk of landslides is not low. The vulnerability of these facilities to slow-moving slides has sometimes been underestimated, although the velocity of some classes of slow slides is uncontrollable. More than 50 cases of slow slides were compiled from the literature for this study. Some statistics about the movement trigger(s), the methods used to measure displacement, the material forming the rupture surface and the type of the vulnerable facilities are presented. It is shown that the expected degree of damage to urban settlements, highways, bridges and dams can be related to the slide velocity or accumulating displacement. Buildings and residential houses may tolerate higher slide velocities and total displacements than other facilities before experiencing serious damage. Movements as low as 100 mm may severely damage bridges, but such low rates may cause only moderate damage to urban communities. The relationship between movement and the expected extent of damage should be useful to geotechnical engineers who deal with different classes of slow slides and will help in the choice of appropriate mitigation measures based on preliminary estimates of movement rates.}

    abstract      = {Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) is widely used for deformation monitoring in mining regions. However, phase unwrapping errors often limit its effectiveness in areas with large-gradient displacements. We propose a novel approach integrating spatiotemporal modeling to address this limitation and improve phase unwrapping. The Simplified Rectangular Dislocation Model (SRDM) simplifies the phase recovery process by reducing model parameters and improving efficiency in large-gradient deformation zones. Subsequently, the Power Exponential Knothe Model (PEKM) is applied to invert the deformation time series and restore the deformation phase from the time dimension. We validated this method using Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2 data in the Majialiang Coalfield, China. The results demonstrate that the approach achieved 5 \% (Sentinel-1) and 14 \% (Radarsat-2) phase range extensions, elevating maximum detectable phase values from 120/100 rad to 160 rad for respective datasets, while the proportions of pixel points with restored phase exceeding 8 rad (-0.035 m) were 17.4 \% and 32.1 \%. The proposed method outperformed conventional techniques in resolving phase discontinuities, demonstrating strong adaptability. This approach significantly enhances subsidence monitoring accuracy and supports sustainable mining operations in coal-dependent regions.}

    abstract      = {Optical flow cannot be computed locally, since only one independent measurement is available from the image sequence at a point, while the flow velocity has two components. A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image.}
